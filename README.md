<h2>Minishell</h2>

Minishell is a 42 School project that challenges students to create a simple Unix shell. The goal is to implement a basic command-line interpreter capable of executing commands, managing environment variables, and handling basic shell features. This project provides a hands-on experience with system calls, processes, and parsing.
